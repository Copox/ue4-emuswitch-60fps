## Mods Available

- **60FPS** 

> [!WARNING]
**THIS MOD IS STATIC**. This means that you'll get slowdowns if you aren't getting Stable FPS.

Otherwise just wait for a Dynamic FPS version (this one is work in progress yet).

> [!NOTE]
If you're a Switch user (real hardware, not emulation) and want stable FPS you need to apply OC (Overclocking) to your Switch

## OC Info (Only for Switch Users. REAL HARDWARE. NOT EMULATION)

I suggest you to take a look at [this guide](https://rentry.co/howtoget60fps)

> [!NOTE]
According to this guide the OC that I'm using it's safe. So don't worry.

I'm a Switch OLED user (Mariko). I tested the mod using:

**Docked Mode**

- CPU: 2397 MHz
- GPU: 1228 MHz
- RAM: 2366MHz

**Handheld Mode**

- CPU: 1224 MHz
- GPU: 844 MHz
- RAM: 2366 MHz

> [!NOTE]
Also tested the following but IMO this need a little bit increase

- CPU: 1224 MHz
- GPU: 614 MHz
- RAM: 1600 MHz

## Versions supported

- **1.12 ONLY** | BuildID: CF82524FEAE270B6C3C8A4C92F757D3D 

> [!NOTE]
SEGA changed some functions between Base Game (1.00) and 1.12. That's why 1.00 is not supported and won't be supported. 

## How to install the mods (for Emulators)

> [!NOTE]
Check this [VIDEO GUIDE](https://youtu.be/ij5fLfaZAWc?si=kBf1FVzheZY5SMgz) to know how to download my mods **if the format is only .pchtxt**

Otherwise, follow the next instructions:

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

## Switch users

You can convert  the .pchtxt files to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch)

Also you just can download the IPS files if they are available.

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips

> [!NOTE]
For now there isn't a FPSLocker patch available.
